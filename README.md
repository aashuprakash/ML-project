# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Sensor-Data
Course Project.
Utilized the unsupervised version of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict human activity by analyzing time series data from three distinct sensors: gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer. Employed advanced techniques such as chunking and statistical feature descriptors for efficient feature extraction. Remarkably, achieved an accuracy of 55% solely through meticulous data preprocessing, without resorting to any supervised learning algorithms
